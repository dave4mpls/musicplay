So now I know which chord the accompaniment keys played (roughly).
I need to now determine how to change the bassline notes to match the played chord.
The idea is that each chord type is associated with its corresponding scale (and my music theory understanding of this bit is a bit iffy).
Another issue is that when I improvise I may play, for example, a ii chord in C major, which is really a D minor chord.  So should I use a D minor scale or a C major scale?
	* This question can be addressed by the question, if I play A in my original bassline and have the key set to C major, should that transcribe to A# or B if I am playing a Dm (ii) chord? B definitely sounds better.  But what my fancy yamaha keyboard does is to play A.  As in, C,E,G,A,G,E bassline gets transposed to D,F,A,A,A,F,D.  Hmmm but why?

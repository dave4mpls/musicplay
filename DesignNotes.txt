So now I know which chord the accompaniment keys played (roughly).
I need to now determine how to change the bassline notes to match the played chord.
The idea is that each chord type is associated with its corresponding scale (and my music theory understanding of this bit is a bit iffy).
Another issue is that when I improvise I may play, for example, a ii chord in C major, which is really a D minor chord.  So should I use a D minor scale or a C major scale?
	* This question can be addressed by the question, if I play A in my original bassline and have the key set to C major, should that transcribe to A# or B if I am playing a Dm (ii) chord? B definitely sounds better.  But what my fancy yamaha keyboard does is to play A.  As in, C,E,G,A,G,E bassline gets transposed to D,F,A,A,A,F,D.  Hmmm but why?
	

========================

Fixing the looping issue.

The first time you press Loop, it determines the amount of time that the looping part loops.  That stays the same OR gets extended with more loops if you add additional measures to the next track.
It's the adding additional measures part that makes it complicated.  Otherwise it would just stay the same and loop around for each additional track.

And of course just looping around at that exact time will not work because what if you're a little off, then the more tracks you add the further off you will be.

Usually after you press loop you want to wait for all the parts to play back at least partway before you segue in with the new track.  If it's an accompaniment track you want it to give you a chance to skip a measure and start on the downbeat.  And not have that recorded as a whole measure of rest time when it loops back again.

It's okay for it to record that as rest time for the last track, since the last track is Melody.
